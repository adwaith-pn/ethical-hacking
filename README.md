<h3>This repository contains code that can be used for penetration testing, grey-hat hacking and black-hat hacking.</h3>


<h2>Penetration testing</h2>

- port scanners - check for available ports given a certain range(which can be modified inside the program) and the name of the host or the IP address of the host. It is also highly efficient compared to other scanners thanks to threading.

- ping - This pings the host given the host name/IP and the port to use.

- more tools will be added in future commits

<hr>

<h2>Grey-Hat hacking</h2>

- Key loggers - when run, the program creates a .txt file which prints out whatever the user is typing. Also works with passwords.

<hr>

<h2>Black-Hat Hacking</h2>

- Ransomware - This program encrypts all the files in the given directory and can only be decrypted by running the decrypt.py file with the passcode at line 19. Please take a look at file.txt first:)

- Worm - This program generates many junk files and folders and takes up a considerable amount of storage on the victim's PC
